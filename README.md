Technical details:

1. The app is written using the Javascript React library.
2. The web API that performs the metrical analysis (or scansion) is at http://aruuz.com/home/api.
3. Web requests are made using the axios library.
4. The UI employs, _inter alia_, components from the Bootstrap and React-Bootstrap libraries.
5. The English-to-Urdu keybord mapping is adapted (in a de-JQueryized form) from https://github.com/awaisathar/yauk.
6. The Urdu font used in the UI is Google's Noto Nastaliq web font. (For more information, please see: https://www.google.com/get/noto/#nastaliq-aran).
